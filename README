BlastEm 0.1.0
-------------

Installation
------------

Extract this tarball to a directory of your choosing. If you wish to change the
configuration settings, copy default.cfg to ~/.config/blastem/blastem.cfg and
modify the copy. You may also whish to add the blastem directory to your PATH
environment variable.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is read from the file at ~/.config/blastem/blastem.cfg if it
exists othwerise it is read from default.cfg from the same directory as the
blastem executable. Sections are denoted by a section name followed by an open
curly bracket, the section's contents and a closing curly bracket. Individual
configuration values are set by entering the value's name followed by a space
or tab and followed by the desired value.

Bindings
--------

The keys subsection of bindings maps keyboard keys to gamepad buttons or UI
actions. The key name goes on the left and the action is on the right.
Most keys are named for the character they produce when pressed. Additionally,
the arrow, enter and escape keys have the symbolic names up, down, left, right,
enter and esc respectively. Other keys that do not produce characters are not
yet supported.

The pads subsection is used to map gamepads and joysticks. Analog axes are not
currently supported. An example configuration is provided in default.cfg to map
SDL joystick 0 to the second controller.

Video
-----

Currently the only setting in the video section is "width", which is the width
of the window in pixels. Height is calculated from this value. Both width and
height can be overridden from the command line.

Audio
-----

The audio section has two config values: rate and buffer. rate selects the
sample rate and buffer sets the size of the output buffer in samples. 512 is
generally a good value, but if you're experiencing audio dropouts you might
want to increase it to 1024.

Debugger
--------

BlastEm has an integrated command-line debugger loosely based on GDB's
interface. The interface is very rough at the moment. Available commands in the
68K debugger are:
	b ADDRESS            - Set a breakpoint at ADDRESS
	a ADDRESS            - Advance to address
	n                    - Advance to next instruction
	c                    - Continue
	p[/(x|X|d|c)] VALUE  - Print a register or memory location
	vs                   - Print VDP sprite list
	vr                   - Print VDP register info
	zb                   - Set a Z80 breakpoint
	q                    - Quit BlastEm
Available commands in the Z80 debugger are:
	b ADDRESS            - Set a breakpoint at ADDRESS
	a ADDRESS            - Advance to address
	n                    - Advance to next instruction
	c                    - Continue
	p[/(x|X|d|c)] VALUE  - Print a register or memory location
	di[/(x|X|d|c)] VALUE - Print VALUE before every debugger prompt
	de BREAKPOINT        - Delete a Z80 breakpoint
	q                    - Quit BlastEm

The -d flag can be used to cause BlastEm to start in the debugger.
Alternatively, you can use the ui.enter_debugger action (mapped to the 'u' key
by default)to enter the debugger while a game is running.
